I am an assistant professor at the Bernoulli Institute (University of Groningen) working in dynamical systems.

My work develops geometric and singular perturbation methods for multiscale and networked systems. I study how degeneracies, constraints, and topology organize global dynamics and bifurcations, particularly in regimes where classical methods and reduction techniques fail.

The research questions I usually work on are motivated by applications in complex physical and biological systems.
